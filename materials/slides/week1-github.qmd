## Activity overview

1.  Make individual changes to files and create 'commits'
2.  Create repository branches to enable you to work more efficiently in parallel.
3.  Merge branches with the main branch via pull request.
4.  Create and resolve a merge conflict.

## Setup

-   have everyone open their GitHub client, the sandbox project in RStudio, and the group sandbox repository in the browser on github.com

-   choose one person to operate the table workstation; have them do the same and log in to github using their credentials

-   on the workstation, create a directory for the class `documents/22f-pstat197a` and clone the group sandbox repo into this directory
