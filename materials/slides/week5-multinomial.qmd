# Dimension reduction

## From last time {.scrollable}

```{r}
# setup
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(modelr)
library(Matrix)
library(sparsesvd)
library(glmnet)
library(knitr)
load('data/claims-multi-tfidf.RData')
load('data/claims-tfidf.RData')
load('data/project-functions.RData')
```

Last time we ended having constructed a TF-IDF document term matrix for the claims data.

-   $n = 552$ observations

-   $p = 15,868$ variables (word tokens)

-   binary (rather than multiclass) labels

. . .

```{r}
claims
```

## High dimensionality, again

Similar to the ASD data, we again have $p > n$: more predictors than observations.

. . .

But this time, model interpretation is not important.

-   The goal is prediction, not explanation.

-   Individual tokens aren't likely to be strongly associated with the labels, anyway.

. . .

So we have more options for tackling the dimensionality problem.

## Sparsity

Another way of saying we have 15,868 predictors is that the predictor is in 15,868-dimensional space.

. . .

***However,*** the document term matrix is extremely sparse:

```{r}
#| echo: true
# coerce DTM to sparse matrix
claims_dtm <- claims %>% 
  select(-.id, -bclass) %>%
  as.matrix() %>%
  as('sparseMatrix') 

# proportion of zero entries ('sparsity')
1 - nnzero(claims_dtm)/length(claims_dtm)
```

## Projection

Since \>99% of data values are zero, there is almost certainly a low(er)-dimensional representation that well-approximates the full \~16K-dimensional predictor.

. . .

So here's a strategy:

-   project the predictor onto a subspace

-   fit a logistic regression model using the projected data

## Principal components

The *principal components* of a data matrix $X$ are an orthogonal basis (*i.e.*, coordinate system) for its column space such that ***the variance of data projections is maximized along each direction.***

-   subcollections of PC's span subspaces

-   used to find a projection that preserves variance

    -   choose the first $k$ PC's along which the projected data retain XX% of total variance

## Illustration

![Image from wikipedia.](img/pcs-wiki.png){fig-align="left"}

## Computation

The principal components can be computed by singular value decomposition (SVD):

$$
X = UDV'
$$

-   columns of $V$ give the projections

-   diagonals of $D$ give the standard deviations on each direction

## Selecting components

1.  Find the smallest number of components such that the proportion of variance retained exceeds a specified value:

    $$
    n_{pc} = \min \left\{i: \frac{\sum_{j = 1}^i d_{jj}^2}{\sum_i d_{ii}^2} > q\right\}
    $$

2.  Select the corresponding projections and project the data:

    $$
    \tilde{X} = XV_{1:n_{pc}} \quad\text{where}\quad 
    V_{1:n_{pc}} = \left( v_1 \;\cdots\; v_{n_{pc}}\right)
    $$

. . .

Projected data are referred to as 'scores'.

## Implementation

Usually `prcomp()` does the trick, and has a `broom::tidy` method available, but it's slow for large matrices.

. . .

Better to use SVD implemented with sparse matrix computations.

```{r}
#| echo: true
start <- Sys.time()
svd_out <- sparsesvd(claims_dtm)
end <- Sys.time()
time_ssvd <- end - start

start <- Sys.time()
prcomp_out <- prcomp(claims_dtm, center = T)
end <- Sys.time()
time_prcomp <- end - start

time_prcomp - time_ssvd
```

## Obtaining projections

```{r}
load('data/project-functions.RData')
```

For today, we'll use a function I've written to obtain principal components. It's basically a wrapper around `sparsesvd()`.

. . .

The following will return the data projected onto a subspace in which it retains at least `.prop` percent of the total variance.

```{r}
#| echo: true
proj_out <- projection_fn(claims_dtm, .prop = 0.7)

proj_out$data
```

## Activity 1 (10 min)

1.  Partition the claims data into training and test sets.
2.  *Using the training data,* find principal components that preserve at least 80% of the total variance and project the data onto those PCs.
3.  Fit a logistic regression model to the training data with binary class labels.

```{r}
claims <- claims_multi

# partition data
set.seed(102722)
partitions <- claims %>% initial_split(prop = 0.8)

# separate DTM from labels
test_dtm <- testing(partitions) %>%
  select(-.id, -bclass, -mclass)
test_labels <- testing(partitions) %>%
  select(.id, bclass, mclass)

# same, training set
train_dtm <- training(partitions) %>%
  select(-.id, -bclass, -mclass)
train_labels <- training(partitions) %>%
  select(.id, bclass, mclass)

# find projections based on training data
proj_out <- projection_fn(.dtm = train_dtm, .prop = 0.7)
train_dtm_projected <- proj_out$data

# bind labels
train <- train_labels %>%
  transmute(bclass = factor(bclass)) %>%
  bind_cols(train_dtm_projected)
```

## Overfitting

You should have observed a *warning* that numerically 0 or 1 fitted probabilities occurred.

-   that means the model fit some data points exactly

. . .

***Overfitting*** occurs when a model is fit *too closely* to the training data.

-   measures of fit suggest high quality

-   but predicts poorly out of sample

. . .

The curious can verify this using the model you just fit.

## Another use of regularization

Last week we spoke about using LASSO regularization for variable selection.

. . .

Regularization can also be used to reduce overfitting.

-   LASSO penalty $\|\beta\|_1 < t$ works

-   'ridge' penalty $\|\beta\|_2 < t$ also works (but won't shrink parameters to zero)

-   or the 'elastic net' penalty $\|\beta\|_1 < t$ AND $\|\beta\|_2 < s$

## Activity 2 (10 min)

1.  Follow activity instructions to fit a logistic regression model with an elastic net penalty to the training data.
2.  Quantify classification accuracy on the test data using sensitivity, specificity.

```{r}
# store predictors and response as matrix and vector
x_train <- train %>% select(-bclass) %>% as.matrix()
y_train <- train_labels %>% pull(bclass)

# fit enet model
alpha_enet <- 0.3
fit_reg <- glmnet(x = x_train, 
                  y = y_train, 
                  family = 'binomial',
                  alpha = alpha_enet)

# choose a strength by cross-validation
set.seed(102722)
cvout <- cv.glmnet(x = x_train, 
                y = y_train, 
                family = 'binomial',
                alpha = alpha_enet)

# store optimal strength
lambda_opt <- cvout$lambda.min

# project test data onto PCs
test_dtm_projected <- reproject_fn(.dtm = test_dtm, proj_out)

# coerce to matrix
x_test <- as.matrix(test_dtm_projected)

# compute predicted probabilities
preds <- predict(fit_reg, 
                 s = lambda_opt, 
                 newx = x_test,
                 type = 'response')

# store predictions in a data frame with true labels
pred_df <- test_labels %>%
  transmute(bclass = factor(bclass)) %>%
  bind_cols(pred = as.numeric(preds)) %>%
  mutate(bclass.pred = factor(pred > 0.5, 
                              labels = levels(bclass)))

# define classification metric panel 
panel <- metric_set(sensitivity, 
                    specificity, 
                    accuracy, 
                    roc_auc)

# compute test set accuracy
pred_df %>% panel(truth = bclass, 
                  estimate = bclass.pred, 
                  pred, 
                  event_level = 'second')
```

# Multinomial regression

## Quick refresher

The logistic regression model is

$$
\log\left(\frac{P(Y_i = 1)}{P(Y_i = 0)}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \cdots + \beta_p x_{ip}
$$

. . .

This is for a binary outcome $Y_i \in \{0, 1\}$.

## Multinomial response

If the response is instead $Y \in \{1, 2, \dots, K\}$, its probability distribution can be described by the *multinomial* distribution (with 1 trial):

$$
P(Y = k) = p_k \quad\text{for}\quad k = 1, \dots, k \quad\text{with}\quad \sum_k p_k = 1
$$

## Multinomial regression

Multinomial regression fits the following model:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\log\left(\frac{p_1}{p_K}\right) &= \beta_0^{(1)} + x_i^T \beta^{(1)} \\
\log\left(\frac{p_2}{p_K}\right) &= \beta_0^{(2)}  + x_i^T \beta^{(2)} \\
&\vdots \\
\log\left(\frac{p_{K - 1}}{p_K}\right) &= \beta_0^{(K - 1)} +  x_i^T \beta^{(K - 1)} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

. . .

So the number of parameters is $(p + 1)\times (K - 1)$.

## Prediction

With some manipulation, one can obtain expressions for each $p_k$, and thus estimates of the probabilities $\hat{p}_k$ for each class $k$.

. . .

A natural prediction to use is whichever class is most probable:

$$
\hat{Y}_i = \arg\max_k \hat{p}_k
$$

## Activity 3 (10 min)

1.  Follow instructions to fit a multinomial model to the claims data.

2.  Compute predictions and evaluate accuracy.

```{r}
# get multiclass labels
y_train_multi <- train_labels %>% pull(mclass)

# fit enet model
alpha_enet <- 0.2
fit_reg_multi <- glmnet(x = x_train, 
                  y = y_train_multi, 
                  family = 'multinomial',
                  alpha = alpha_enet)

# choose a strength by cross-validation
set.seed(102722)
cvout_multi <- cv.glmnet(x = x_train, 
                   y = y_train_multi, 
                   family = 'multinomial',
                   alpha = alpha_enet)

preds_multi <- predict(fit_reg_multi, 
        s = cvout_multi$lambda.min, 
        newx = x_test,
        type = 'response')

pred_class <- as_tibble(preds_multi[, , 1]) %>% 
  mutate(row = row_number()) %>%
  pivot_longer(-row, 
               names_to = 'label',
               values_to = 'probability') %>%
  group_by(row) %>%
  slice_max(probability, n = 1) %>%
  pull(label)

pred_tbl <- table(as.character(pull(test_labels, mclass)), pred_class)
```
