## Before we begin...

1.  Identify the row number you are sitting.

2.  Please sign in using the attendance reporting form found here:

    [Attendance reporting form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdSZhPOz5CRHg23aOegnwJzjKNndAdcc2LvS3LSL0z7ZBmh-g/viewform?usp=sf_link)

# General orientation

## Welcome

PSTAT197A/CMPSC190DD is the first course in UCSB's year-long data science capstone sequence.

-   ***Audience:*** undergraduate students of any discipline with a basic background in data science and an interest in research

-   ***Aim:*** prepare for an independent research or project experience

## Capstone projects

Most students are preparing for capstone projects in winter and spring. Course foci were chosen with this in mind.

-   Projects are varied ➜ emphasize problem patterns over methodology
-   Projects are collaborative ➜ emphasize teamwork and discussion
-   Projects are specialized ➜ practice independent learning based on use cases

Read about past projects at <https://centralcoastdatascience.org/projects>

## Continuing in capstones

Continuation in PSTAT197B-C/CMPSC190DE-DF during winter and spring:

-   students admitted to this course in spring have a seat;

-   students admitted from the waitlist are on the waitlist.

## Outcomes

I hope to support all of you in:

-   using modern software with version control for collaboration;
-   recognizing problem patterns based on data semantics and research questions;
-   identifying and accessing resources for independent learning given a problem of interest;
-   communicating data analysis and/or research findings.

## Classroom environment

We are in an interactive classroom for a reason: to interact!

Let's acknowledge:

-   Preparations and areas of expertise vary widely among the class

-   It's okay not to know things

-   If you have a question, probably someone else does too


# Course content and structure

## Modules

The course is configured in modules defined by a dataset and questions (much like a project).

A module typically comprises:

-   One session on data introduction (lecture/discussion)

-   Two sessions on problem patterns and related methodology (lecture)

-   Two labs with related examples (section meeting)

-   One session on sharing data analysis results (discussion)

## Module content

The module datasets are currently as follows:

-   Class intake survey data (exploratory/descriptive analysis)

-   Biomarkers of autism (predictive modeling and variable selection)

-   Web fraud (text processing and deep learning)

-   Soil temperatures (correlated data)

## Group assignments

Each module you will be assigned a working group.

Your group's objective is to produce an analysis of the dataset:

-   **Reproduce** analysis presented/discussed in class meeting

-   **Extend** the analysis **by**

    -   applying an ***alternative method*** that addresses the same question(s)

    -   **or** addressing a ***corollary question***

## Vignettes

At the end of the class in place of a fifth module you will create a *vignette* (short demonstration) on a topic of interest.

-   present a use case

-   explain methodology

-   demonstrate implementation with example code

## Expectations and assessments

# Looking ahead

## Next time

We'll discuss:

-   data science as a discipline;

-   the research landscape;

-   systems and design thinking for data science.

## Checklist

Complete all of the following [***before***]{.underline} our next meeting.

1.  Review all content in the about section of the course webpage.
2.  Install course software and create a GitHub account.
3.  Fill out [capstone project intake form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdRUs6jXQg1PnhzL1ZB0FlFcgV_4szJ-7zAdNW7uGT_6aBvFw/viewform?usp=sf_link).
4.  Read [Peng, R. D., & Parker, H. S. (2022). Perspective on data science. *Annual Review of Statistics and Its Application*, *9*, 1-20.](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-statistics-040220-013917) (access online via UCSB library).
5.  Prepare a [reading response](https://forms.gle/n2GpNGMVXVaAXSWf9).
