## Announcements/reminders

Make your final commits for the first group assignment by ***Friday 10/14 11:59pm PST***

-   should include an updated `report.qmd` and `report.html` with your write-up

. . .

Next group assignment to be distributed Tuesday 10/18.

-   Groups will be randomly assigned

-   Task: replicate and redesign proteomic analysis

## Last time

-   introduced ASD proteomic dataset

-   used multiple testing corrections to identify proteins whose serum levels differ significantly between ASD/TD groups

-   discussed the difference between controlling familywise error vs. false discovery

## Today

We'll talk about two more approaches to identifying proteins of interest:

-   correlation-based identification of proteins

-   random forest classifier

# Correlation with ADOS

## ADOS score

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
asd <- read_csv('data/biomarker-clean.csv')

# same preprocessing as before
trim_fn <- function(x){
  x[x > 3] <- 3
  x[x < -3] <- -3
  
  return(x)
}

asd_clean <- asd %>% 
  # log transform
  mutate(across(.cols = -group, log10)) %>%
  # center and scale
  mutate(across(.cols = -group, ~ scale(.x)[, 1])) %>%
  # trim outliers (affects results??)
  mutate(across(.cols = -group, trim_fn)) %>%
  # ados only for ASD group
  filter(group == 'ASD') %>%
  select(-group)
```

Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) scores are determined by psychological assessment and measure ASD severity.

```{r}
#| echo: true
asd %>% 
  select(group, ados) %>% 
  group_by(group) %>% 
  sample_n(size = 2)
```

-   `ados` is only measured for the ASD group

-   numerical score between 6 and 23 (at least in this sample)

## Correlation approach

So here's an idea:

-   compute correlations of each protein with ADOS;

-   pick the 10 proteins with the strongest correlation

## Computation

This is a simple aggregation operation and can be executed in R with `summarize()` :

```{r}
#| echo: true
# compute correlations
asd_clean %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -ados,
               names_to = 'protein',
               values_to = 'level') %>%
  group_by(protein) %>%
  summarize(correlation = cor(ados, level))
```

## Visual assessment

```{r}
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-align: center
ados_cors <- asd_clean %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -ados,
               names_to = 'protein',
               values_to = 'level') %>%
  group_by(protein) %>%
  summarize(correlation = cor(ados, level)) %>%
  arrange(correlation) %>%
  mutate(abs.corr = abs(correlation),
         rank = row_number()) 

# plot correlations
ados_cors %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = rank,
             y = correlation)) +
  geom_path() +
  geom_point(data = slice_max(ados_cors, abs.corr, n = 10)) +
  geom_text(data = slice_max(ados_cors, abs.corr, n = 10),
            aes(label = protein, hjust = 'inward'),
            check_overlap = T,
            size = 3)
```

## Sort and slice

::: panel-tabset
### List

```{r}
# top 10
ados_cors %>% slice_max(abs.corr, n = 10)
```

### Visual

```{r}
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-align: center
## visualize
selected_proteins <- ados_cors %>% 
  slice_max(abs.corr, n = 10) %>%
  pull(protein)

asd_clean %>%
  select(c(ados, any_of(selected_proteins))) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -ados,
               names_to = 'protein',
               values_to = 'level') %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = level, y = ados)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(formula = 'y ~ x', method = 'lm', se = F) +
  facet_wrap(~ protein, nrow = 2)
```
:::

## SLR coefficients instead?

*Fact:* the simple linear regression coefficient estimate is proportional to the correlation coefficient.

. . .

So it should give similar results to sort the SLR coefficients by significance.

. . .

```{r}
# regression approach (equivalent)
fit_fn <- function(.df){
  lm(ados ~ level, data = .df)
}

ados_slr <- asd_clean %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -ados,
               names_to = 'protein',
               values_to = 'level') %>%
  nest(data = c(ados, level)) %>%
  mutate(fit = map(data, fit_fn),
         fit_tidy = map(fit, broom::tidy)) %>%
  unnest(fit_tidy) %>%
  filter(term == 'level') %>%
  select(protein, estimate, p.value) 

ados_slr %>% arrange(p.value)
```

## FDR control

If we do the correlation analysis this way, do the identified proteins pass multiple testing significance thresholds?

```{r}
# do these pass multiple testing?
m <- ncol(asd_clean) - 1
hm <- log(m) + 1/(2*m) - digamma(1)

ados_slr %>%
  mutate(rank = row_number(),
         p.adj = p.value*m*hm/rank) %>%
  slice_min(p.value, n = 10) %>%
  select(protein, p.value, p.adj)
```

-   probably just introducing selection noise

-   but also, this result diverges considerably from the paper (?)

## Aside: correlation test {.scrollable}

The SLR approach is equivalent to sorting the correlations. (Take a moment to check the results.)

. . .

We could use inference on the population correlation to obtain a $p$-value associated with each sample correlation coefficient. These match the ones from SLR.

```{r}
#| echo: true
cor_test <- function(x, y){
  cor_out <- cor.test(x, y)
  tibble(estimate = cor_out$estimate,
         p.value = cor_out$p.value)
}

asd_clean %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -ados,
               names_to = 'protein',
               values_to = 'level') %>%
  group_by(protein) %>%
  summarize(correlation = cor_test(ados, level)) %>%
  unnest(correlation) %>%
  arrange(p.value)
```

# Random forest activity

## Background

A ***binary tree*** is a directed graph in which:

-   there is at most one path between any two nodes

-   each node has at most two outward-directed edges

![](img/binary-tree.png)

## Classification tree

A ***classification tree*** is a binary tree in which the paths represent classification rules.

![A goofy classification tree.](img/silly-tree.png)

## Example: classifying high earners {.scrollable}

Say we want to predict income based on captial gains and education level using census data.

```{r}
library(rpart)
library(partykit)
library(tidymodels)
library(tidyverse)

# data location
url <- "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.data"

# import
census <- read_csv(url,
                   col_names = c("age", 
                                 "workclass", 
                                 "fnlwgt", 
                                 "education",
                                 "education_1",
                                 "marital_status",
                                 "occupation",
                                 "relationship",
                                 "race",
                                 "sex",
                                 "capital_gain",
                                 "capital_loss",
                                 "hours_per_week",
                                 "native_country",
                                 "income")) %>%
  mutate(income = factor(income)) %>%
  select(-fnlwgt, -education_1) %>%
  mutate(educ = fct_collapse(education,
                             advanced = c('Doctorate', 
                                          'Masters',
                                          'Prof-school'),
                             college = c('Some-college',
                                         'Assoc-acdm',
                                         'Assoc-voc',
                                         'Bachelors'),
                             other_level = 'hs')) 

set.seed(101322)
census %>% 
  select(income, educ, capital_gain) %>% 
  group_by(income) %>%
  sample_n(3)
```

. . .

We could construct a classification tree by 'splitting' based on the values of predictor variables.

```{r}
#| fig-height: 5
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-align: center
set.seed(101322)
train <- census %>%
  sample_n(size = 1000, replace = F)

tree <- rpart(income ~ capital_gain + educ, 
              method = 'class',
              data = train)

plot(as.party(tree))
```

## Activity: building trees

To get a sense of the process of tree construction, we'll do an activity in groups: each group will build a tree 'by hand'.

-   first let's look at the instructions together

-   then take about 15-20 minutes to do it

## Random forests

A random forest is a classifier based on many trees. It is constructed by:

-   building some large number of $T$ trees using bootstrap samples and random subsets of predictors (what you just did, repeated many times)

-   taking a majority vote across all trees to determine the classification

. . .

So let's take a vote using your trees!

## Variable importance scores

If the number of trees $T$ is large (as it should be):

-   trees are built using lots of random subsets of predictors

-   can keep track of which ones are used most often to define splits

. . .

***Variable importance scores*** provide a measure of how influential each predictor is in a random forest.

## Results {.scrollable}

Back to the proteomics data, the variable importance scores from a random forest provide another means of identifying proteins.

```{r}
library(randomForest)
asd_clean <- asd %>% 
  select(-ados) %>%
  # log transform
  mutate(across(.cols = -group, log10)) %>%
  # center and scale
  mutate(across(.cols = -group, ~ scale(.x)[, 1])) %>%
  # trim outliers (affects results??)
  mutate(across(.cols = -group, trim_fn))

# store predictors and response separately
asd_preds <- asd_clean %>% select(-group)
asd_resp <- asd_clean %>% pull(group) %>% factor()
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
# grow RF
set.seed(101222)
rf_out <- randomForest(x = asd_preds, y = asd_resp,
                       mtry = 100, ntree = 1000, 
                       importance = T)

# variable importance
rf_out$importance %>% 
  as_tibble() %>%
  mutate(protein = rownames(rf_out$importance)) %>%
  slice_max(MeanDecreaseGini, n = 10) %>%
  select(protein)
```

## Errors

But how accurate is the predictor?

```{r}
# errors
rf_out$confusion %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

## Next week

-   logistic regression

-   variable selection

-   a design view of the proteomic analysis
