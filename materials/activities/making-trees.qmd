For the purposes of this activity we'll use data from the 1994 census (there are fewer variables than the proteomics data and sometimes a little variety is nice).

::: callout-important
## Action

Open a new R script and copy-paste the chunk below to load the data.

You will not need to store a copy of your work (unless you want to) -- so the script is just to be able to perform some simple calculations during class.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

# data location
url <- "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.data"

# import
census <- read_csv(url,
                   col_names = c("age", 
                                 "workclass", 
                                 "fnlwgt", 
                                 "education",
                                 "education_1",
                                 "marital_status",
                                 "occupation",
                                 "relationship",
                                 "race",
                                 "sex",
                                 "capital_gain",
                                 "capital_loss",
                                 "hours_per_week",
                                 "native_country",
                                 "income")) %>%
  mutate(income = factor(income)) %>%
  select(-fnlwgt, -education_1)

census %>% head(4)
```

Your group's job is to build a tree to classify high earners and low earners based on a bootstrap sample and a random subset of predictors.

The `income` variable is the response or variable of interest; the rest are potential predictors.

```{r}
# inspect repsonse
census %>% pull(income) %>% str()
```

## Building a tree

### Step 1: resample the data

First, draw a sample with replacement from the observations. This is known as a *bootstrap* sample. We'll keep this relatively small to simplify matters.

::: callout-important
## Action

**Draw a bootstrap sample**

Copy the code chunk below and execute once.

```{r}
# resample data
census_boot <- census %>%
  sample_n(size = 200, replace = T)
```
:::

You will build your tree using this data.

### Step 2: select predictors at random

Next draw a set of predictors at random. We'll also keep this set small so that you can develop the tree 'by hand'.

::: callout-important
## Action

**Select two random predictors**

Copy and paste the code chunk below into your script and execute once without modification.

```{r}
# retrieve column names
possible_predictors <- census %>% 
  select(-income) %>%
  colnames()

# grab 2 columns at random
predictors <- sample(possible_predictors,
                     size = 2, 
                     replace = F)

# select these columns from the bootstrap sample
train <- census_boot %>% 
  select(c(income, any_of(predictors)))
```
:::

You will build your tree using only these predictors from the bootstrap sample as *training* data.

### Step 3a: find your first split

Now your job is to choose exactly one of the predictors to make a binary split of the data.

-   for categorical variables, determine which categories you will classify as high-income vs. low-income

-   for continuous variables, choose a cutoff value so that any observation greater/less than the cutoff is classified as a high/low (or vice-versa) earner

***You do not need to make quantitatively rigorous choices.*** Try to make a choice that you think is reasonable, but don't agonize over it. The code below might help you decide which variable to use and how to make the split: use it to inspect each of the two variables and decide which one better distinguishes the income groups.

```{r}
# comment out -- don't overwrite your bootstrap sample!
census_boot <- census %>% 
  sample_n(size = 200, replace = T)

# for continuous variables
census_boot %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, # replace with predictor name 
             y = income)) +
  geom_jitter(height = 0.1) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 35) # adjust cutoff

census_boot %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, # replace with predictor name
           y = ..density..)) +
  geom_density(aes(color = income, fill = income),
               alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 35) # adjust cutoff


# for categorical variables
census_boot %>%
  group_by(workclass, income) %>%
  count() %>%
  spread(income, n) %>%
  mutate_all(~ replace_na(.x, 0)) %>%
  mutate(high.inc = `<=50K` > `>50K`)

# pick out categories that are majority high income
highinc_categories <- census_boot %>%
  group_by(workclass, # replace with predictor name
           income) %>%
  count() %>%
  spread(income, n) %>%
  mutate_all(~ replace_na(.x, 0)) %>%
  mutate(high.inc = `<=50K` < `>50K`) %>%
  filter(high.inc == T) %>%
  pull(workclass) # replace with predictor name
```

::: callout-important
## Action

**Make your first split**

1.  Choose whichever of the two predictors you think best distinguishes the high income and low income groups.
2.  Find a cutoff value if the variable is continuous, or the categories that you will classify as high income if the variable is categorical.
3.  If categorical, store a vector of the category names that are classified as high income (see code above). If continuous, store the cutoff value.
4.  Write down the rule.
:::

### Step 3b: find your second split

Now filter the data to just those rows classified as (but not necessarily actually) high income based on your first split.

```{r}
# continuous case -- example
census_boot_sub <- census_boot %>%
  filter(age > cutoff)

# categorical case -- example
census_boot_sub <- census_boot %>%
  filter(workclass %in% highinc_categories)
```

::: callout-important
## Action

**Find a second split**

1.  Repeat step 3a but with the filtered data `census_boot_sub` instead of the full bootstrap sample.
2.  Write down the rule.
:::

### Step 4: draw the tree

We could in theory keep creating binary splits until all observations are correctly classified. However, since we're doing this by hand and just for illustration purposes, we'll stop after two splits.

::: callout-important
## Action

**Make a diagram**

Draw your tree by hand. It should have just one 'root' node and just three 'leaf' nodes.
:::

## Classifying a new observation

Use your tree to determine how to classify the following observation:

```{r}
census %>%
  sample_n(size = 1) %>%
  t() %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

## Algorithmic considerations

You just did a loose version of what's known as *recursive partitioning --* repeatedly splitting the data. That's a specific method of constructing a tree.

How did you decide which of your two variables to use? Could you write code to make the same choice automatically? This, it turns out, is the main challenge in fully automating the process. The recursive partitioning algorithm requires two things:

1.  a criterion by which one split is considered 'better' than another
2.  a stopping rule

It is fairly simple to compute the best cutoff (or categorical mapping) for a given predictor -- one can do a brute-force search for the split that minimizes misclassifications. However, when there are many possible variables to split on, a criterion is needed to determine the best choice. You can read about how this is done in [MDSR 11.1.1](https://mdsr-book.github.io/mdsr2e/ch-learningI.html#decision-trees).
